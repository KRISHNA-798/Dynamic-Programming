//Here we discuss about Floyd warshall algorithm (All pair shortest path).
firstly what is this algorithm and why is it needed (most important Question we get while studying every algorithm)
Here basically we are given with a senario where we have to find the shortest path between given points (In real life consider shortest path between cities and towns to optimize
the values in map), and to achieve this we found an famous algorithm called "dijkstra's algorithm of shortest path". We were able to achieve the shortest path but them
why floyd's again , here it is because the dijkstra had a few constraints like it may or may not produce correct result if the input had -ve values( Here we basically use a mtrix to 
store initial values and give it to the algorithm , it can be +ve or -ve). so in order to overcome this constraint we developed floyd's algorithm (All pair shortest path).
Another big Question why using dynamic programming specifically?
